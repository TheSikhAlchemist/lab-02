## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: For the UDP, when the 50% was added, only 50% of the values were going through. When UDP tends to fail to write a message, it does not send it again which is the reason why were missing 50% of the numbers

Answer for Question 2: For TCP, when the 50% was added, it started to load in the numbers in very late compared to it being faster before. When TCP tends to fail to write a message, it reruns the failed message and then prints them. This is why it printed all the numbers but took some time. 

Answer for Question 3: The speed changed based on the number of numbers you input within the client. If you add more numbers, it takes longer because the TCP checks all the numbers and tries to read in its errors too, so it takes longer to read and print.
